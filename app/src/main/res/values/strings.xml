    <string name="moneylines_details">The moneyline bet is another common type of wager at any sportsbook. There are no spreads and other challenges.\n\nA bettor’s sole objective is to predict which team will win a particular game. There are some differences between the market and how bettors approach it when seeking a payout.\n\nBettors can choose to lay points with a favorite or take points with an underdog. Instead of taking points with the favorite, they can risk more or less money depending on which side they support.\n\nIf they choose to back a favorite, bettors are required to take a higher risk. They can also back the underdog, which is a lower-risk option that could result in a greater payout.</string>

    <string name="over_under">OVER/UNDER</string>
    <string name="over_never_details">You don’t need to be concerned about who wins; the over/under is all you care about is the total score of both teams at the conclusion of the game. Below is a brief guide on how to place over-under bets in various sports.\n\nIf you are online betting on totals in baseball, you will likely see numbers between 6.5 and 12. If you see seven runs, it means that there is a pitcher’s duel. If the number is 12 or more, it usually means there are two pitchers who are bad and two strong offenses.\n\nIf you bet on totals in basketball, you can expect numbers to be in the vicinity of 200. One game projected to have a low-scoring game might see a total score of 180, while a high-scoring one could see a total score of 225.\n\nThe numbers are lower in college. The average number of totals you might see is 120 to 150. They have a slower shot clock, and therefore the games are shorter.\n\nFootball totals are based on the combined score of both teams. A low-scoring NFL game will usually have a total of anywhere between 30 and 35 points. Shootouts will see a total of between 50 and 55 points. Sometimes, these numbers may be higher. In college football, for example, the score would be somewhere between the 70s and 80s.\n\nTotal bets, like all other types of sports betting options, have grown. A total bet is not only available for pre-game wagers. Totals may also be available for individual teams or quarters, as well as live betting.\n\nIf you wager on the under, it means that you are betting more than the market’s applicable total points, runs, sets goals, or other markets. The opposite is true for the under: you expect fewer events to occur.\n\nThis is a common way to wager on over/under bets. If you anticipate 51 points or more, you take over, and if you expect 50 points or less, you take under. However, these markets may sometimes be less intuitive than others.</string>
    <string name="teaser_bets_details">Teasers require bettors to win bets on multiple sporting events. However, the twist is more favorable to bettors. Bettors can move the lines in their favor by a specific number of points instead of picking every game at the lines set out by the sportsbook.\n\nThis reduces the payout for winning the teaser, but it also increases the chance of winning the parlay.</string>
    <string name="betting_against_details">Spread betting is one of the mainstays of sports betting. Spread betting allows a bettor to predict which team will win by using a handicap and the score of the team they are placing their bets on.\n\nPoints will be subtracted from the score of a favorite team when you place a wager. Points will be added to the wager on an underdog.\n\nSpreads in sports such as the NHL or MLB, which are often close-score games, tend to be around 1.5 goals or runs. In addition, spreads can be larger in sports such as football and basketball, where there are wider margins in talent gaps.</string>
    <string name="prop_bets_details">Prop bets are a great way for sports bettors to get off the beaten path. Prop bets are short for proposition bets and cover intricate aspects of major sports games. Props can be used to cover individual performances or teams and are more detailed during larger events like the Super Bowl.\n\nMany team props cover topics such as whether a team will score on its first possession or if they will score an odd number or even number. Player props ask questions about how players perform in games; for instance, how many rebounds they collect during a contest.\n\nProp bets can be more entertaining than traditional online betting markets, but they require more knowledge about the tendencies of the players and teams involved.</string>
    <string name="parlays_details">"Parlays are a more fun way to make money with online betting on sports. The parlay requires that bettors place multiple bets, and all bets must win to make the parlay wager to cash.\n\nThese are usually done by casual bettors, who don’t wait for major events such as the Super Bowl or March Madness. If they hit, payouts are often much greater than single bet wins.</string>
    <string name="futures_details">Futures betting requires patience more than other types of bets because bettors must predict who will win a competition. These bets can be placed before the season starts, and bettors have an entire league from which to choose their champion.\n\nThis can lead to huge payouts in less predictable leagues, such as the NHL or MLB. Even though there are fewer players in college basketball and NCAA basketball, the payouts can still be impressive for accurately predicting the future.</string>
    <string name="total_rounds_detail">To bet on totals, you must predict how many points a game will have and whether it will exceed or fall below the online betting amount. This kind of betting is popular in the NFL and NBA, where stylistic differences are more apparent than in other sports.\n\nMany sports provide totals for both the individual teams and all of them. The total score for the NFL game between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots might be 42.5 points.\n\nThe Jets’ team total might be 17.5 points. This market is heavily bet on because it offers more options for bettors when they are betting on totals.</string>

    <string name="beat_d">Overlyzer live tool maps the pressure situations in soccer matches from over 1,000 leagues and competitions – in real time. This allows Overlyzer users to see at a glance which team is applying more pressure and dominating the game./nThe “Game Offense Factor” also interprets whether a game is more offensive or more defensive based on various statistics and live performance data. On average, a value of 30% or more over the full duration of the match indicates that the game is being played offensively and actively with likely more goals…</string>
    <string name="x_d">A betting strategy that has been successful in the past is the bet on the “double chance” 1X if an outsider plays against a favorite at home. In this case, the “1X” bet brings respectable odds and very interesting profit opportunities./nHome win or draw betting strategy/nYou don’t even have to choose and analyze games that contain absolute extremes and obvious class differences with this strategy. So, you don’t necessarily have to bet against Barcelona, Bayern or Juventus as an away team. Here, we would probably move away from the value bets. Even if we opt for teams that are not big outsiders, but are still outsiders according to the odds, we find highly interesting odds between 1.60 and 2.50./nAs with all bets, it is important to analyze in advance and not blindly going for any team. You should of course take statistics into account, advance information about injuries and suspensions, as well as the current shape of the teams. The home advantage of the outsider, for whom games in front of their own audience against a “bigger one” also represent a special motivation, should not be underestimated as it brings another small advantage for the home team. Especially when the respective favorite has recently shown itself shaky against “smaller ones”, you can definitely find value in such an outsider bet with double chances./nIf you also accept lower odds, you can of course also use this 1X strategy for games that have balanced odds.</string>
    <string name="all_in_d">This betting strategy involves winning numerous bets one after the other and always using the maximum offers the opportunity to earn decent money. But it is also clear that all the money is gone if you lose a bet. But if you manage to win 30, 35, maybe even 40 times in a row, you’ll get big money!/nAll–in on odds at 1.20 – betting strategy/nWe use odds around 1.20 for this – ideally you should look for the bets you are playing live. As with the strategy of betting over 1.5 goals in what is estimated to be typical “over” games, you can wait here until the odds have reached the desired level. The over 0.5 bet is ideal here – i.e. the bet that the game will not end 0–0. Usually, after goalless 30 minutes, you get a rate of 1.20 – depending on the match, this can of course be lower, but sometimes even higher. Of course, it is a matter of taste with which type of bet you want to monetize your betting sequence, or money race‘ as it is also called./nIt is important that you always play roughly the same odds. This is certainly a test of patience and not particularly spectacular at first, but there is no exact goal and you can stop at any time and have your winnings paid out. For example, if you start such a series of bets with a stake of 10 €, that’s all you can lose. So you now find a bet with odds 1.20, win it and immediately play the 12 € you won again on odds that are around this amount. You win 14.40 € – which will be invested in the next bet./nThe profits will only become noticeable very slowly, but will increase sharply over time, because of course the stake grows higher and higher. If you actually manage to get 30 picks right in a row, your 10 € from the beginning will already be a whopping 2,373.76 €. After 35 correct pick we would already be at 5,906.68 € and after 40 correct picks at 14,697.71 €./nOf course, it is far from likely to have so many tips in a row right – but this progressive betting strategy is also something for the thrill. If you do not start the betting sequence with too high a stake, you cannot lose much and there is of course the possibility of starting a real streak when employing this betting strategy.</string>
    <string name="sysytem_d">The 1 3 2 6 system is similar to another positive progression betting system known as a Paroli. Both involve increased stakes after a win, and both involve a cycle of bets ending at a fixed point. The only real difference is the actual betting sequence./nThere are not many systems that are easier to understand than 1–3–2–6 and its simplicity is very appealing to many players. There are also a number of other benefits that contribute to its popularity./nOf course, as in any betting system, there are also disadvantages. We explore the positive and negative aspects of the 1 3 2 6 below, along with the details and how it is used./nUse of the 1 3 2 6 system/nLike many betting systems, the 1 3 2 6 was designed for bets that pay out an even sum, like the red-black bets in roulette. In fact, it is widely used on the roulette table and in other casino games such as baccarat, dice games and blackjack. Basically, it doesn’t matter what you use it for, provided you are playing with even sums./nAs mentioned earlier, this is a very simple system. All you have to do is adjust your bets based on a few simple rules. First of all, you have to decide how high your betting unit should be. As a guide, once you’ve set the amount you’re willing to lose in one session, your betting unit should be around 2% to 5% of that./nFor example, if you wanted to play with a total of 500 €, 10 € would be a reasonable number. A bet unit is the amount you wager on the first bet in the sequence. After every lost bet, the sequence ends and you start a new one – and again you insert a betting unit./nIf you win a bet, you adjust your stake according to the sequence 1-3-2-6. So, if you win your first bet, the next time you increase your stake to € 30 (three betting units). If you win this too, you will place € 20 on your next bet. If you win this too, the next time you wager € 60. And already we have the 1-3-2-6 sequence./nIf you win the fourth, consecutive bet then the sequence is completed and you start all over again. Don’t forget, as soon as you lose, your stake will also reset to a betting unit./nThis is basically what the 1-3-2-6 betting system is all about. As long as you keep the simple set of rules in mind, you shouldn’t have any problems using this system successfully./nPossible outcomes of 1-3-2-6/nSince this system is only a short cycle, there are few possible outcomes. These are the following:/nLoss of the first bet (total loss of one betting unit)/nFirst bet won, second bet lost (total loss of two betting units)/nFirst two bets won, third bet lost (total win of two betting units)/nWon the first three bets, lose the fourth bet (breakeven)/nWin all four bets (total win of 12 units)/nSo, as you can see, only two of the possible outcomes of a cycle involve loss. A loss will only occur if the first or second bet is lost. So, every time you win the first two bets, you cannot lose again in the same cycle./nIt may seem like the 1-3-2-6 system makes it more likely to make money than to lose. But unfortunately, this is not true. Unfortunately, while the system has some advantages, the guaranteed profit isn’t one./nAdvantages and disadvantages of the 1-3-2-6 betting strategy/nPerhaps the greatest advantage of 1-3-2-6 is that it is very simple and easy to learn. If you want to use a betting system that you don’t want to be overly complicated, this is a good option. In addition, your stake is not increased after a loss – this prevents the rapid loss of money, especially if you choose the size of your betting units sensitively./nAnother notable advantage is that after stopping the sequence after four consecutive wins and then going back to one unit, you are facing the possibility of a small winning streak. There is a chance that you will win all four times in a row – and if you are lucky, your winnings will exceed the losses on bets you lost before./nThe system does not come without its disadvantages; the most striking is that there is nothing to beat the house edge that exists in any casino. No betting system can do this. But it helps you to maintain discipline with a set of rules to be followed, because ultimately you still have to rely on your luck to win. If you get the wrong sequence of results, you will lose./nThe 1-3-2-6 isn’t a bad betting system compared to any of the other systems available, provided you accept it for what it is. This system doesn’t guarantee that you will win, but it can help you get the most out of your luck.</string>
    <string name="fibbonacci_d">The Fibonacci betting system is one of many betting strategies available today. Here we explain what it is all about.\n\nThe Fibonacci betting strategy\n\nFibonacci sequence betting is undoubtedly a controversial concept. But there are definitely sports bettors who were able to achieve great success with it. This strategy carries some risks, but with the necessary luck and the right nose, you can be successful while employing this strategy.\n\nThe basic concept of betting according to the Fibonacci sequence is simple: bet on a tie. If you lose, just bet on the next tie according to a certain key and start increasing your stake.\n\nIt is important that the odds for the tie are above 2.62 (more precisely: 2.618); luckily for those who want to employ this strategy, there are many tie bets for this minimum odds. The higher the rate, the better.\n\nFibonacci Betting Strategy\nBetting after Fibonacci\nIf you lose, you simply bet the next tie after a Fibonacci sequence. It is a sequence of numbers in which the sum of two consecutive numbers results in the next number, making the Fibonacci sequence an infinite sequence of natural numbers. You can find more information about the Fibonacci sequence on Wikipedia.\n      So if you start betting with 1 € on the first draw with odds> 2.62 and lose, then the next time you bet 1 € again, then 2 €, then 3 €, then 5 €, then 8 €, then 13 € and so on.\n\nIt is mathematically understandable that every profit that you will achieve with this bet will offset the previous losses and you will even make a net profit.\n\nAn example of the Fibonacci bet\n\nLet’s take the example of the situation where you lose ten times in a row and win your bet the eleventh time. In this case, you have already gambled away 143 € and finally successfully placed the eleventh number in the Fibonacci sequence, 144, on a bet. If we now assume that the successful bet had odds of @ 2.80, you win 403.20 €. You have wagered a total of 287 €, making your net profit 116.20 €.\n\nThe disadvantage of this strategy is also obvious. Assuming you lose not ten bets in a row, but twenty, then you would have already lost 16,910 € in stakes. This is a huge bankroll, which you should of course never risk for such a betting sequence. You can find more about this in our explanations on bankroll management.\n\nThe Fibonacci betting system – our conclusion\n\nWhen betting according to the Fibonacci sequence, you depend on timely success. Otherwise, you will eventually no longer be able to afford the stakes and you will lose a lot of money. Of course, this strategy can also work well. For example, you can focus on a specific team that is known to draw often. But purely based on the theory of probability, one day you will surely get into a stage that you can no longer manage financially.</string>
    <string name="kelly_d">There are of course numerous ideas, concepts and formulas that can help you calculate the ideal stake on a bet. One of them is the Kelly formula.\n\nOf course, this is no guarantee that you will always bet correctly and the assessment of how likely the outcome of a game is, does still remain up to you. But the Kelly formula can help you choose the size of your bet.\n\nThis is how the Kelly formula works\n\nYou choose a game or an event and rate the outcome as a percentage\nExample: Austria defeats Germany – you rate this outcome with a probability of 20%\nNow, you are looking for an odd for this event that seems fair to you\nThen, you put the probability and the odds in the Kelly formula and get a value from it\nLet us take as an example the 20% probability of winning with odds of @ 5.50.\nFirst we do the math, where the probability of 100% is 1:\n      Now we can continue to calculate and find the best possible stake for this bet. The formula used to choose a reasonable stake looks like this:\n\nPercentage of bankroll to be set = value / (odds – 1)\n      The Kelly Formula hereby recommends that, given the probability that you have determined yourself and the odds you have chosen, you should bet 2.22% of your bankroll on this event.\n\nNow, of course, the use of this formula also depends heavily on your assessment of the probability. And if you consider a game outcome to be very likely and thus increase the value considerably, then it can happen that you get 30% or even more of your bankroll as a result. Of course, caution is advised here because your bankroll can slide down very quickly this way.\n\nIt is also possible that you will get a negative result when calculating the first value. This happens if you bet too low with an expected probability of winning on an event with too low odds. The result is that your value is negative, which means nothing else than: if you are unsure about this, then this bet just doesn’t pay off …</string>
    <string name="dutching_d">Dutching is the process of betting on more than one selection during the same event, so that no matter which selection wins, a profit can be made. This should not be confused with arbitrage, which involves betting on all possible outcomes of an event, so that a guaranteed profit is generated. This is only possible by using several bookmakers and only for a few events.\n      Dutching is ideal for multi-outcome events where you think you can break the possible outcomes down to two or three; but in theory, you can bet on any number of selections. The fewer selections you make in dutching, the fewer losers you support and the more profit you make from them. However, by dutching fewer selections, you increase your risk.\n\nDutching is best used when you either have information or have a very strong feeling that an outcome is very unlikely. If those unlikely outcomes have huge odds, then dutching is not worthwhile, but if you think the desired outcome is unlikely, then the remaining selections in dutching pay good dividends.\n\nDetermination of the different stakes in dutching\n\nThe main characteristic of Dutching is that you win the same amount, but with all the different odds involved, it can sometimes be difficult to figure out the stakes required.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you cover two selections, one with 5/1 and one with 8/1 and you want to win 100 € regardless of the outcome:\n\nDivide the odds in decimals (6.0 and 9.0) and divide the stake by the decimal odds.\n\n100 € / 6.0 = 16.66 €\n100 € / 9.0 = 11.11 €\nTotal stake = 27.77 €\n\nAlternatively, you might have an idea of how much you want to bet on an event; in this case it’s around 30 €. You know that your stake on the 0.6 chance is around 20 €. To calculate how much you should bet on the other selection:\n\n20 € x (6.0 / 9.0) = Bet on the higher valued selection. = 13.33 €\n\nThe total stake would then be 33.33 € and if one of the two selections wins you will receive 120 €\n\nCalculate combined odds in dutching\n\nIn dutching, it is important that the selections you are betting on have combined odds. To pick the best bets, you still need to consider odds and choose events where your combined selections have the best chance of winning in relation to your odds, rather than simply supporting all of the selections you think might win.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you bet a total of 100 € and the return on a winning bet is 150 €, then you cover all of your selections with combined odds of 1/2 or 1.5 as a decimal number.\n\nWhen placing your Dutch bet, you have already worked out your stakes and total returns so that you can place the bet, with the same return for each outcome. To get the decimal odds for your bet, you simply divide your total stake by your returns.\n\nIt may seem difficult to estimate the combined odds when the numbers are a little more random, such as 279 € win for 82 € stake, but it is very easy to figure out:\n\n279 € / 82 € = odds of 3.4, which is roughly 5/2.\n\nAdvantages of dutching\nOffers new possibilities\nOne of the greatest advantages of dutching is that it creates new opportunities for profit. In the past you may have broken a race down to two horses, but it wasn’t easy to choose these two horses and so you left the race. Alternatively, you might have guessed that a soccer game would end with very few goals, but you weren’t sure whether you should bet on 0-0 or 1-0. With dutching, you can get paid off for both of these situations.\n\nStill getting value\nJust because you’re betting more than one outcome, this doesn’t mean you won’t get any value from your bet. If you think a low-rated favourite is very unlikely to win, then two or more high-rated selections in this event could offer great value. If the added up returns from the combined bet are greater than the chance that those outcomes will win, you will generate value through dutching.\n\nMore winning bets\nBy dutching you reduce your overall odds, but increase your chances of winning your bet. In theory, this should result in more winning bets and therefore more frequent betting returns. This helps to protect your betting account from dry spells and should also offer you some joy in betting.\n\nDisadvantages of dutching\nWeakening of profit\nThe more selections you make in dutching, the more you reduce your overall odds in each betting event. Whenever you decide to add new selections, you have to take into account the fact that your betting rate needs to improve, so that a certain level of profit can be maintained. If you use dutching and don’t win very often, you will lose your money very quickly.\n\nReverse dutching\nReverse dutching sounds complicated, but it’s just dutching for trade. The same principles apply; the more choices you make, the more likely your bet will win, but the less money you will win. And on the contrary, the fewer selections you make, the less likely it is to win and the more profitable any winning bet is.</string>
    <string name="early_d">Have you ever regretted placing a particular bet and wished that you could somehow withdraw it? Or maybe you had doubts as to whether the team you supported could really hold the lead? If your answer to any of the questions is yes, then you’ll love the early withdrawal option. These properties give the speculator more control over the bets already placed and could ultimately make a big difference in the overall bankroll if you wager your cards correctly. The early payout is often referred to as the cashout by most sports betting sites.\n\nWhat is the early withdrawal option?\n\nThe early withdrawal option allows sports bettors to withdraw their bets early, before they have been settled. So, you can either make a profit or get a part of your stake back, depending on your selection at that time. The feature is available as soon as you have placed your pre-match or in-play bet and the payout amount will fluctuate based on the events taking place in the game.\n\nThe cashout feature is available for individual bets and accumulator bets, but note that it does not apply to all bet types, such as the outcome (1×2) and some other popular markets. Speculators can take advantage of the exciting option when placing their bets in soccer, tennis, basketball, cricket, baseball and even horse racing – on both desktop and mobile.\n\nWhen to make an early cashout\n\nIf the team or player you are supporting is in a winning position but is being led out by the opponent, then you should definitely make a cashout and secure the appropriate profit instead of watching your potential profit and stake vanish into thin air. Your forecast proves correct and your choices lose the lead.\n\nAlternatively, the option of paying out can also be used to limit losses, which can be a very good strategy in the long term. If your selection doesn’t win at the moment, and it doesn’t seem like things are going to turn, it is wise to withdraw early on, so that you can be sure that you get some of your deposit back. This may not seem like a popular strategy, but it can definitely help speculators stay afloat for longer periods of time.</string>

    <string name="beat_live_d">With this betting strategy, you are betting on live games on the bet type “Over 1.5 goals”.\n\nThe “live over 1.5 goals” betting strategy\n\nLive betting on “over 1.5 goals” is a very lucrative betting strategy. This bet has an interesting advantage due to the development of the odds. First of all, you should do the same thing as with normal over / under bets. Find a game where you expect an over 2.5. Only use this betting strategy for bets where you expect this.\n\nBefore the game, the odds of an over 1.5 will be very low. In some cases, it is no higher than 1.20. But while the game is running and the goals are missing, this rate increases almost every minute and becomes more and more lucrative. Now you have to be patient. Ideally – as with any bet – you should watch the game live at the same time in order to have the greatest possible advantage.\n\nNow wait until the bet has odds between 1.50 and 2.00. The higher the better, but of course the timing is important. If a goal is scored, the bet is over before it has even started and you have to find a new game. This strategy only works if it is 0-0 long enough. Usually, you will have to wait until the 35th to 55th minute so that the odds on the over 1.5 are fair. However, we recommend that you still bet in the first half – it is important that the odds are 1.50 or higher.\n\nYou analyzed the game before kick-off and expected an over 2.5. If you’re not completely wrong, goals will still be scored here. And we are eagerly awaiting the first goal as soon as the bet is played.\n\nIf a goal is scored quite early after your bet, then you have – at least with most bookmakers who allow this – a profitable exit strategy: The odds for the over 1.5 will of course rattle off after the first goal. Now you can have the bet paid out via cashout, you can virtually “sell” it. You will definitely get out with a plus.\n\nThe riskier option is to wait for the second goal and win the bet anyway. Here it is of course advisable to watch the game live. If there is a goal in the air, you can still wait and let the bet stand. If the game is a tense affair, then it may be better to sell the bet.\n\nIn any case, for such a strategy it is advisable to bet with a betting company that allows a live cashout option.
